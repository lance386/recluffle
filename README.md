# What is RE:Cluffle?

Cluffle used to be an awesome way to browse reddit while at work, but sadly the creator <a href="http://www.reddit.com/u/Lutan">/u/Lutan</a> decided to take it down.

This project is in no way mine, but I want to keep Cluffle around for those dreary hours at the office and am working on improving the app as we speak.

Again, CLUFFLE IS NOT MINE, I am just a former user who wanted to resurrect this glorious project.
